      Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about
    anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han?
    I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

    Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains 
    of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some
